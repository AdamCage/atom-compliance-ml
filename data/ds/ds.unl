Trigger:
The vehicle sensors detect a collision and activate the emergency communication feature.
The driver manually presses in_19. SOS button (roof console)activate the emergency communication feature.
Main Scenario:
The ERA-Glonass initiates emergency service communication.
During the emergency call, the safety audio system automatically mutes or lowers the volume of other audio sources within the vehicle, such as the radio, navigation prompts, or entertainment systems.
The public safety answering point (PSAP) receives critical information about the situation, location, and the nature of the emergency from the In-vehicle system and occupants' answers.
The communication continues until the PSAP determines that it is safe to end the call or until the situation is resolved.
Once the emergency communication ends, the safety audio system restores the audio sources to their previous settings, or the driver can manually unmute the audio via in_2.
Postconditions：
The driver is able to communicate with the emergency services via ERA-Glonass.
Alternative Scenarios:
A. ERA-Glonass Malfunction
There is a notification display on out_2, out_5 when the ERA-GLONASS has an error.
If ERA can not be activated, the driver or passengers may need to use personal mobile devices in_5.Smartphone or other means to contact emergency services.

Functional Description

Self-diagnosis after ERA is started (in ERA state).

Enabling conditions (a):

a. ERA is working properly;

Trigger conditions (a):

a. In ERA state

Execution output (a&b&c&d):

a. Every time the ignition switch is turned on (hw.KL15ON), ERA needs to activate the self-diagnosis function and conduct a self-diagnosis; ERA starts self-diagnosis when the vehicle is turned on. Self-diagnosis lasts about 30s.

b. In ERA state, ERA performs self-diagnosis every cal.ERASelfTest (Default 1min TBD);

b. The ERA needs to switch to internal battery power supply at cal.ERASelfTest (Default 1min TBD).

c. Self-diagnosis includes the following items:

- proper operation of GSM/UMTS communication module interface;

- proper operation of GNSS receiver;

- sufficient charging level of backup battery;

- proper operation (correct connection) of external GNSS antenna (if installed);

- proper operation of airbag collision CAN signal (automatic RTA detector);

- proper operation of UIM;

- proper operation of microphone;

- proper operation of speaker;

Self-diagnosis includes the following items:

- proper operation of GSM/UMTS communication module interface;

- proper operation of GNSS receiver;

- sufficient charging level of backup battery;

- proper operation (correct connection) of external GNSS antenna (if installed);

- proper operation of airbag crashed CAN signal (automatic RTA detector );

- proper operation of UIM;

- proper operation of microphone;

- proper operation of loudspeaker.;

d. After a fault is detected cal.ERASelfTestNum (Default 1 times TBD) within each power-on period, the ERA records the fault to the internal EEPROM; And control the System into the System Fault state, control the LED state (refer to the Ecall switch indicator drive)

Exit conditions/Exit conditions：

NA

Notes：

①If the ignition is off after the software downloading is complete, the ERA shall update the software image in non-volatile memory, and then perform a self-diagnosis cycle.

②If the ignition is on after the software downloading is complete, the ERA shall update the software image in non-volatile memory, and perform a self-diagnosis cycle after the ignition is turned off.
